##  PRECISION  CLASSIFICATION BRAIN TUMOR USING 3D U-NET MODEL
Leveraging the features of 3D U-Net model to classify the brain tumors accurately and efficiently reducing the vulnerability of the patient.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Precision classification brain tumor using 3D U-Net model project helps to classify the brain tumor based on the dataset of MRI images of various patients into methylated and non methylated tumors. Classifying the brain tumors would provide a fast and easiest approach for the timely treatment of the patient. This would reduce the vulnerability of the patient because of the traditional surgical method. 

## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
- Implements advance neural network method.
- A framework based application for deployment purpose.
- High scalability.
- Less time complexity.
- A specific scope of Chatbot response model, using json data format.

## Requirements
<!--List the requirements of the project as shown below-->
* Operating System: Requires a 64-bit OS (Windows 10 or Ubuntu) for compatibility with deep learning frameworks.
* Development Environment: Python 3.6 or later is necessary for developing the 3D U-Net model for brain tumor classification.
* Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow for model training, MediaPipe for hand gesture recognition.
* Image Processing Libraries: OpenCV is essential for efficient image processing and real-time hand gesture recognition.
* Version Control: Implementation of Git for collaborative development and effective code management.
* IDE: Use of pycharm or any online compilers such as google colab or kaggle notebook with required packages installed.
* Additional Dependencies: Includes scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow GPU and XgBooster.

## Results and Impact
The integration of machine learning algorithm 3D U-Net model increases the efficiency of brain tumor classification which is the primary step to start the treat for the particular turmor. This would reduce the time required for classification and rhe risk to be faced due to traditional surgical procedure where the patient has to endure the pain.


This project serves as a foundation for future developments in assistive technologies and contributes to creating a more inclusive and accessible digital environment.
